<p><strong>Please submit to Canvas via the <em>text box submission</em>, I’ll then download and circulate the comments to your group members!</strong></p>

<p>For this component you will evaluate another team’s project. Download and open the .ipynb file for the team’s project. Please respond to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What dataset is the other team analyzing and how were these data collected? Are there any issues with the data collection described? What are potential sources of bias?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the project limitations listed by the authors, are there additional limitations to what the authors can conclude from their analysis of this dataset?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After evaluating the team’s question, hypothesis, and analyses, suggest another question and/or analysis you would conduct with this data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you agree with the team’s interpretation of their results? Why or why not? Are there alternative interpretations?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After evaluating the team’s presentation quality plot, identify 1 strength and 1 weakness of the plot.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Milestone 2 is <strong>due Sunday, 2/12 by 11:59pm PT to Canvas</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Note: Like before, please have each member of your group submit a copy of the same notebook to Canvas.</em></p>

<h4 id="project-milestone-2-goals">Project Milestone 2 Goals:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Clean and wrangle your data and describe this process.</li>
  <li>Visualize and summarize each of your variables and interpret what you see.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="in-class-today-you-should">In class today, you should:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>brainstorm with your group an approach for cleaning your data, including – for example – what columns/rows you’re going to keep, any transformations that might need to be made (like going from long –&gt; wide format or vice versa), calculating new metrics with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mutate()</code>, etc.</li>
  <li>are you going to have to merge datasets? if so, by which columns will you link them by, and is there any missing and/or mismatching data that you might need to account for when doing the merge (and if so, how can you go about fixing it)?</li>
  <li>start looking through the questions for Milestone 2 (there aren’t as many questions as the previous milestone to provide you the flexibility to really start digging deep and exploring your data)</li>
  <li>if there are complex cleaning operations that you’re considering doing – and you’re not sure which functions from the tidyverse/base R are going to help you perform those operations – start writing down questions/googling as well as asking Shawn for support (office hours are a great extended time outside of section to work through these more complex coding issues)</li>
  <li>on that note, I’ve also placed a few “cheat sheets” below that are helpful for data wrangling and visualizations in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code> – feel free to check them out and experiment with different visualizations to get a grasp on what your underlying data look like!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="about-the-milestone-2-notebook">About the Milestone 2 notebook…</h4>

<p>You may have noticed that the first portion of the Milestone 2 skeleton notebook contains empty cells for the Milestone 1 questions. This is intentional so that you can build upon your project planning document as well as to constantly remind you of your research question and hypotheses as you’re digging into your data. As such, please copy-paste the contents of your Milestone 1 notebook that you turned into me on Sunday into this new skeleton so that everything stays together and your group has grounding as you all tackle this next portion of the project together – thanks!</p>

<p>Your first milestone is <strong>due Sunday, 1/29 by 11:59pm PT to Canvas</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Note: Please have each member of your group submit a copy of the same notebook to Canvas.</em></p>

<h4 id="project-milestone-1-goals">Project Milestone 1 Goals:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Identify your question and explain why you are asking it</li>
  <li>Identify, briefly describe, and read in your dataset to R</li>
  <li>Identify and describe the variables you will use to test your hypothesis</li>
  <li>Identify how you will need to clean/wrangle your dataset</li>
  <li>Identify limitations of your project as a whole</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="in-class-today-you-should">In class today, you should:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>continue discussions with your group about your shared topics of interest and the direction you’re thinking of going in for your project</li>
  <li>begin exploring possible datasets (using either the dataset resources that I’ve provided and/or looking online for other datasets, e.g., Kaggle, datasets from previously published papers, etc.)</li>
  <li>brainstorm potential research questions for your project</li>
  <li>start working on filling out the <strong>Milestone 1 Notebook Skeleton</strong> (which includes guiding questions for your group to carefully think about when designing your research question, hypothesis, and dataset)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll be walking around chatting with each group after you’ve had some time to pick back up on where the discussions with your group left off from last time.</p>

<h4 id="by-the-end-of-class-today-you-should">By the end of class today, you should:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>elect one group member to email Shawn a brief summary of the question(s) your group is actively considering addressing for the final project (please CC your other group members on the email)</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll then aim to get you feedback on your current questions before the start of next week’s section</li>
