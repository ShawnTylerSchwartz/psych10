title: "Week 2: Getting Started on Project Milestone 1"
---

Today we'll focus on getting started with Project Milestone 1.

Your first milestone is **due Sunday, 1/29 by 11:59pm PT to Canvas**.

_Note: Please have each member of your group submit a copy of the same notebook to Canvas._

#### Project Milestone 1 Goals:

- Identify your question and explain why you are asking it
- Identify, briefly describe, and read in your dataset to R
- Identify and describe the variables you will use to test your hypothesis
- Identify how you will need to clean/wrangle your dataset
- Identify limitations of your project as a whole

#### In class today, you should:

- continue discussions with your group about your shared topics of interest and the direction you're thinking of going in for your project
- begin exploring possible datasets (using either the dataset resources that I've provided and/or looking online for other datasets, e.g., Kaggle, datasets from previously published papers, etc.)
- brainstorm potential research questions for your project
- start working on filling out the **Milestone 1 Notebook Skeleton** (which includes guiding questions for your group to carefully think about when designing your research question, hypothesis, and dataset)

I'll be walking around chatting with each group after you've had some time to pick back up on where the discussions with your group left off from last time.

#### By the end of class today, you should:

- **elect one group member to email Shawn a brief summary of the question(s) your group is actively considering addressing for the final project (please CC your other group members on the email)**
- I'll then aim to get you feedback on your current questions before the start of next week's section
